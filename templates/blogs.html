            <h3>How AI is Revolutionizing Farming Decisions</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is transforming agriculture by enabling data-driven decisions for crop selection, pest control, and irrigation management. Through machine learning models trained on soil health, weather, and market trends, farmers can now optimize every stage of crop production.</p>
            <p>This digital shift not only increases yield but also promotes sustainable practices by reducing water and fertilizer waste. With mobile-based AI tools, even small-scale farmers in rural areas can benefit from advanced technologies previously available only to large agribusinesses.</p>

        <div class="blog-card">
          <img src="static/6.jpeg" alt="Blog">
          <div class="blog-content">
            <h3>Building Weather-Resilient Farming Systems</h3>
            <p>Climate change has made weather patterns unpredictable, affecting planting cycles and crop output. Integrating climate-smart practices—like crop diversification, agroforestry, and early warning systems—can help farmers adapt.</p>
            <p>Government and private apps now offer hyper-local forecasts, helping farmers make informed decisions about sowing, harvesting, and irrigation. Investing in resilient varieties and infrastructure is key to future-proofing agriculture.</p>
